# Project on building classifiers for medical images.

## Introduction

The aim of this project is develop classifiers for medical images,
such as X-rays. For example, the classifier is trained on images
of lungs, some of which may be labelled as having covid of being
healthy. The clasifier then should be able to determine whether a new x-ray
of a lung is healthy or the patient has covid. See
[this general review of classifiers of medical images](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S093938891830120X).

## Tutorials

To learn about the basic idea of building image classifiers, please
work thorugh the following online tutorial.

* [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
* Work through this kaggle tutorial on building an image classifier
  [Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning)
* [Computer Vision](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision) 

The use of Jupyter notebooks is recommended to run python.

* https://jupyter.org/
* Google allows jupyter notebooks to run in their data centers [Google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/)


See this example of an image classifier for
